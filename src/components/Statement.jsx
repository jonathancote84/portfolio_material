      I work in many media from clay, paper maché, epoxy, electronics, sound, code, 3d math. The medium is a port of the work but in a lot of cases it is just what output makes sense for a given context.

      A lot of the content of my work focuses more in contrasts. What is the role of Nature in this Anthropocene? It is still there, very necesary to life on the planet and we can’t ignore it A major theme of my work is a broad concept Humans using Technology to melt into and symbiotically merge with nature. The contrasts of this is important in my work because of what it shows about the human ability to overcome our own self created distructive forces. Glitches, aberations and noise are analogous to a lot of the forms I see in nature. So I think contrasts develop in that, and this  can bring out a naturalistic beauty trapped inside the very technologies which might be very unnatural on there own.

      <p>	The interplay between human existence in the natural world and our  Relations to the Technologies we create are a source of inspiration In my work. I see my work as creating an interfaces a means to find mergers, strange understandings and some beauty in a the cold and numerical nature of the building blocks of the Technologies we create and live with.</p>
